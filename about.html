    <h1>Health Awareness</h1>

    <p>
        Health awareness means understanding the importance of maintaining good physical,
        mental, and emotional well-being. A healthy person can work efficiently, think
        clearly, and enjoy life more fully. Health awareness helps people make better
        decisions about their lifestyle and habits.
    </p>

    <h2>Importance of Health Awareness</h2>
    <p>
        Health awareness plays a vital role in preventing diseases and promoting a
        healthier society. When people are aware of health risks and healthy habits,
        they are more likely to adopt a balanced lifestyle and avoid harmful behaviors.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>“Prevention is better than cure.”</strong><br>
        Being aware of health issues helps in early detection and timely treatment.
    </div>

    <h2>Physical Health</h2>
    <p>
        Physical health refers to the condition of the body. Regular exercise, a balanced
        diet, proper sleep, and personal hygiene are essential for maintaining physical
        fitness. Simple activities like walking, cycling, and playing outdoor games
        improve stamina and strength.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Eat fresh fruits and vegetables daily</li>
        <li>Drink enough clean water</li>
        <li>Exercise at least 30 minutes a day</li>
        <li>Avoid junk food and sugary drinks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mental Health</h2>
    <p>
        Mental health is as important as physical health. Stress, anxiety, and depression
        can affect daily life. Talking to family members, practicing meditation, and
        maintaining a positive attitude can improve mental well-being.
    </p>

    <p>
        A healthy mind helps in better concentration, emotional balance, and decision
        making. Students with good mental health perform better academically and socially.
    </p>

    <h2>Healthy Lifestyle Habits</h2>
    <p>
        A healthy lifestyle includes good habits such as waking up early, maintaining
        cleanliness, eating on time, and avoiding addictions like smoking and alcohol.
        These habits contribute to long-term health and happiness.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Maintain personal and environmental cleanliness</li>
        <li>Get 7–8 hours of sleep daily</li>
        <li>Limit screen time and mobile usage</li>
        <li>Practice yoga or meditation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Role of Health Awareness in Society</h2>
    <p>
        Health awareness programs help communities understand diseases, vaccinations,
        sanitation, and nutrition. Schools, hospitals, and governments play an important
        role in spreading health-related information among people.
    </p>

    <p>
        A healthy society is more productive, peaceful, and prosperous. By spreading
        awareness, we can reduce the burden of diseases and improve the quality of life
        for everyone.
